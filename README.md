An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of a brain tumor involves using magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. This non-invasive imaging technique provides high-resolution pictures that reveal important information about the size, location, and characteristics of the tumor. MRI is preferred for brain tumor imaging due to its excellent soft tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation. Advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can offer further insights into the nature and behavior of brain tumors, aiding in treatment planning.
